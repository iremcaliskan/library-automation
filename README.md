# library-automation
 I worked on a project that includes ASP.NET MVC pattern and MSSQL connection with using Visual Studio.
This project is a library automation system. It is an example of automation of university libraries. Students
can log into the system with the password and e-mail provided by their university. That way they can
observe the system. Library staff do their book delivery transactions through this system. There is a
punishment system for books that are not received.
